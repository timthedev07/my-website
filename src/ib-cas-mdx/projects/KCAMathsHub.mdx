# Project Introduction

A community-based platform for providing peer-assistance with Math school work and questions; currently under development and will be available internally at KCA.

## Group Members

This project is a collaboration between Elena, Mykola, and Tim; see below for the formal list of members' information:

- Elena Zhuang {"<"}[Email](mailto:elena.zhu@kcpupils.org){">"}
- Mykola Starovoit {"<"}[Email](mailto:mykola.sta@kcpupils.org){">"}
- Xiyu (Tim) Bao {"<"}[Email](mailto:tim.bao@kcpupils.org){">"}

# Learning Outcomes Addressed

1. Identify your own strengths and develop areas for personal growth.
2. Demonstrate that challenges have been undertaken, developing new skills in the process.
3. Demonstrate how to initiate and plan a CAS experience/project.
4. Show commitment to and perseverance in CAS experiences.
5. Demonstrate the skills and recognize the benefits of working collaboratively.
6. Recognize and consider the ethics of choices and actions.

# CAS Stages

## Investigation

We have been observing that there isn't a widely used internal platform for students to seek help from more experienced or senior school members. So we have decided to build a web app to satisfy this potentially demanding need.

The project aims to build a fully functional and intuitive web-based platform for students to ask questions and provide peer assistance to those needing help.

I am expected to spend at least around 2 hours every day on the project, and I have reached this standard and got far enough with the development in the past month or so. This will continue until the release of the initial version, and by then the hours will be maintenance and customer service, which emphasizes service.

## Preparation

- In-person meetings for the planning and design of the website.
- Designing the website structure and the database structure.
- Distributing tasks based on each member's capabilities.

The three of us will divide the work into each of our areas of expertise:

- Tim will be in charge of the backend and serverside code of the app, the functionality-based APIs on the front end with tRPC and Prisma, and the overall project management.
- Mykola will be in charge of implementing Elena's UI design.
- Elena will be in charge of designing the visual layout of the website.

# Reflections

## 31/10/2023

Recently, I initiated a recruitment process for our "answerer" team. Managing the HR and marketing aspects of the project was a new experience for me. Taking a break from actual development allowed me to experiment with interacting with people I didn't know, who wanted to join and contribute to the project. This gave me the opportunity to learn how to manage and establish positive personal interactions to achieve effective communication.

Collaboration with my colleagues was essential before moving forward. We needed to exchange ideas and suggestions regarding the design of the recruitment poster and application form. At the point where we reached a consensus upon the content of these documents, I made them publicly available with the assistance of my mathematics teacher to help spread the information around.

The recruitment process was surprisingly successful. Yesterday afternoon, approximately eight people expressed interest in joining, which motivated me to finalize all the documents quickly to ensure the best stakeholder experience with the project.

## 13/10/2023

For the past month or so, I have been in charge of managing the project's progress and coordinating my co-workers. I have arranged several meetings and and composed organizational emails in the process to ensure that my colleagues are aware of the pace and requirements.

Moreover, I am responsible for the backend development of the platform and so spent a huge amount of time designing, trying, and implementing the required actions on the server side, which includes database management and migrations, using libraries to interact with the client side and the database to establish a connection bridge between the two.

During the development phase, I have gained familiarity with the technological tools such as tRPC, Prisma, TypeScript, and Next.js. Learning to adapt to the brand new version of Next.js was challenging; the development conventions had a huge change and it took time for me to read over the documentation and familiarize myself with the new concepts.

When designing the database, we've formed agreement to display a username of the student's choice, or the default one, in order to hide their actual name. For ethical concerns, the users' data will be safely stored and their names will not be exposed on the platform due to privacy reasons and the GDPR.

Developing a mid scale project is complex and time consuming, the initial plan changed as time goes. However, with successful communication with my colleagues, being able to efficiently distribute tasks reduces my workload and adds a diversity of ideas into our project.
