# Project Introduction

A community-based platform for providing peer-assistance with Math school work and questions; currently under development and will be available internally at KCA.

## Group Members

This project is a collaboration between Elena, Mykola, and Tim; see below for the formal list of members' information:

- Elena Zhuang {"<"}[Email](elena.zhu@kcpupils.org){">"}
- Mykola Starovoit {"<"}[Email](mykola.sta@kcpupils.org){">"}
- Xiyu (Tim) Bao {"<"}[Email](tim.bao@kcpupils.org){">"}

# Learning Outcomes Addressed

1. Identify your own strengths and develop areas for personal growth.
2. Demonstrate that challenges have been undertaken, developing new skills in the process.
3. Demonstrate how to initiate and plan a CAS experience/project.
4. Show commitment to and perseverance in CAS experiences.
5. Demonstrate the skills and recognize the benefits of working collaboratively.

# CAS Stages

## Investigation

We have been observing that there isn't a widely used internal platform for students to seek help from more experienced or senior school members. So we have decided to build a web app to satisfy this potentially demanding need.

The project aims to build a fully functional and intuitive web-based platform for students to ask questions and provide peer assistance to those needing help.

I am expected to spend at least around 2 hours every day on the project, and I have reached this standard and got far enough with the development in the past month or so. This will continue until the release of the initial version, and by then the hours will be maintenance and customer service, which emphasizes service.

## Preparation

- In-person meetings for the planning and design of the website.
- Designing the website structure and the database structure.
- Distributing tasks based on each member's capabilities.

The three of us will divide the work into each of our areas of expertise:

- Tim will be in charge of the backend and serverside code of the app, the functionality-based APIs on the front end with tRPC and Prisma, and the overall project management.
- Mykola will be in charge of implementing Elena's UI design.
- Elena will be in charge of designing the visual layout of the website.
