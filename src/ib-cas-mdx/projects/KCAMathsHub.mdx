# Learning Outcomes Addressed

1. Identify your own strengths and develop areas for personal growth.
2. Demonstrate that challenges have been undertaken, developing new skills in the process.
3. Demonstrate how to initiate and plan a CAS experience/project.
4. Show commitment to and perseverance in CAS experiences.
5. Demonstrate the skills and recognize the benefits of working collaboratively.
6. Recognize and consider the ethics of choices and actions.

# CAS Stages

## Investigation

We have been observing that there isn't a widely used internal platform for students to seek help from more experienced or senior members of the school. So we have decided to build a web app to satisfy this potentially demanding need.

## Preparation

- In-person meetings for the planning and design of the website.
- Designing the website structure and the database structure.
- Distributing tasks based on each member's capabilities.

The three of us will divide the work into each of our areas of expertise:

- Tim will be in charge of the backend and serverside code of the app, the functionality-based APIs on the front end with tRPC and Prisma, and the overall project management.
- Mykola will be in charge of implementing Elena's UI design.
- Elena will be in charge of designing the visual layout of the website.

## Action
