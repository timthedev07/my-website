# Reflections

## 29/09/2023

I was engaged in the entire process of management of the associated tasks and the preparation and delivery of the lessons.

Our group spent a vast amount of time researching the historical background and tweaking the visual display to ensure that our lecture met a high standard.

Being the group leader, I was faced with challenges such as assigning clear tasks with deadlines and coordinating different colleagues. It was a sub-group of the Chinese student committee, and the consequence was that we were all busy with schoolwork and hence had less time to focus on the preparation. Thus, carefully distributing and balancing the workload by assigning different sections of the lesson to different members based on their strengths was required of me. In the end, we collaborated satisfactorily and managed to present our month-long hard work to the students at the local Chinese Academy.

The first time delivering a public lecture to a group of audience of a size of around 50 people was demanding, as it needed great confidence and public speaking fluency. I practiced my section again and again to ensure a nearly flawless presentation and that sufficed to boost my self-assurance and quality of performance.

The main global issue addressed by this project is **"identity and culture"**. Facing a group of younger teenagers mostly born in Spain or having spent the majority of their earlier-stage life, the loss of awareness of their root culture and identity was an emerging problem. Hence, this project was initiated primarily aimed at raising cultural awareness and reinforcing their sense of identity and belonging to the Chinese community and heritage.
