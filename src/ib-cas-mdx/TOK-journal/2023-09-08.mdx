<br />

**Does knowledge always require some kind of rational basis?**

> Yes. Proofs and investigations are required to prove a conjecture and validate one's knowledge, as it is in mathematics. Believing something told by others without the intention to find out the reality ourselves can be seen as irresponsible and lacking in inquiry skills.

<br />

**Do we have a moral responsibility to share what we know?**

> Everyone has different perspectives and logical thinking, hence we should not be forced to accept anyone else's idea and one of the only ways to form knowledge in a given area is to make observations and find proof.

<br />

**Is the truth what the majority of people accept?**

> No, believing in our own perceptions and findings instead of accepting what the majority of people believe promotes critical thinking and the ability to validate a piece of information ourselves.
