# CAS Stages

## Investigation and Preparation

- Obtaining the past papers at https://bmos.ukmt.org.uk/home/bmolot.pdf and referencing the corresponding solutions on their official website.
- Out of all of the past problems, 109 of them have solution videos. So to make sure I am able to validate my own workings, I'll focus on the most recent 109 problems.
- I am expecting to allocate enough time for around 2 problems a day to make sure I go through all of them before the contest.

## Action

- Attempt the past papers and verify my approaches with their solutions whenever needed.
- Record my progress in the web application I made
