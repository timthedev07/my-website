# Reflections

## 13/11/2023

The Chiffon cake was more intricate and skill-demanding than I anticipated: the timings have to be controlled perfectly even at the stage of preparation to ensure that the bubbles within the cream obtained from egg white don't disappear due to long time of inactivity. Multiple problems were encountered during the stage of cooking. Firstly, I had to control the water usage in general and electricity usage of the electric whisk to ensure that the experience is as environmentally friendly as it could be. Furthermore, the timings provided in the tutorial were inaccurate or potentially incompatible with my appliances, so I had to make slight modifications to ensure success. Overall, it was the most challenging recipe I have attempted, but having established the basis provides me with more confidence to recreate the recipe on the day before her birthday.
