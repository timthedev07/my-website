# Reflections

## 16/11/2023

Having woken up at 4:10 A.M., I had approximately 3.5 hours of limited time to complete two recipes, one of which was relatively complicated compared to the other. Effective time management was crucial as I had to carefully organize my steps in the correct order within this short time frame. There were more stages than I had initially anticipated, including the clean-up process, which involved washing a considerable number of dishes and kitchenware. However, in the end, I managed to execute all tasks as planned and completed the challenge before 8 A.M.

Energy and water consumption were again major ethical and environmental concerns. Nonetheless, improvements were made, and resource usage was further restricted to be as environmentally friendly as possible.

## 13/11/2023

The Chiffon cake proved to be more intricate and skill-demanding than I had anticipated. Timings had to be controlled perfectly, even during the preparation stage, to ensure that the bubbles within the egg white cream were preserved and didn't disappear due to prolonged inactivity. Several challenges emerged during the cooking stage. Firstly, I needed to manage water and electricity usage efficiently, making sure the electric whisk operated in an environmentally friendly manner. Additionally, the timings provided in the tutorial were either inaccurate or potentially incompatible with my appliances, necessitating slight modifications for success. Despite being the most challenging recipe I have attempted, establishing this foundation gives me more confidence to recreate the cake on the day before her birthday.
