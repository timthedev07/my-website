# Introduction to The Activity

Inspired by the fascinating graphs learned from Math lessons, I decided to combine my knowledge of graphs and produce a piece of text written on the Cartesian coordinate system on my graphical calculator.

# Focus

Addressed Learning Outcomes:

1. Identify your own strengths and develop areas for personal growth.
2. Demonstrate that challenges have been undertaken, developing new skills in the process.
3. Demonstrate how to initiate and plan a CAS experience.
4. Show commitment to and perseverance in CAS experiences.

## Investigation

By going through the alphabet and identifying that, for a simpler version, all texts can be represented by grouped pieces of functions with restricted domains and ranges. E.g. the letter A can be regarded as a concave absolute value function with a steep gradient and grouped with a straight horizontal line somewhere in between the two halves of the graph.

Moreover, having to graph functions in a certain interval was something new and that I had to spend time researching.

## Preparation

For a quick visual start, I drew a quick sketch of the final graph on a grid paper:

Calculating the coordinates and finding all of the functions with necessary domains:

## Action

Inputting the functions into the calculator:

## Demonstration

# Reflections...

## Beforehand

Producing the required functions one by one will require a lot of work but I personally think it is an excellent opportunity for me to learn how to take full advantages of the graphical calculators.

## During the Action

Calculating each piece of graph requires a lot of precise working out, which involves identifying the type of functions required for each piece and substituting correct values into the equations to determine the functions individually.

It was challenging and took a lot of time, although the process wasn't as dull as I anticipated.

In the middle, I realized that the calculator only allows up to 20 functions, and so I compromised and altered my design.

## Afterward
