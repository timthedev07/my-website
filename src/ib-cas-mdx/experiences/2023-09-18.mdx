# Introduction to The Activity

Inspired by the fascinating graphs learned from Math lessons, I decided to combine my knowledge of graphs and produce a piece of text written on the Cartesian coordinate system on my graphical calculator.

# Focus

Addressed Learning Outcomes:

1. Identify your own strengths and develop areas for personal growth.
2. Demonstrate that challenges have been undertaken, developing new skills in the process.
3. Demonstrate how to initiate and plan a CAS experience.
4. Show commitment to and perseverance in CAS experiences.

## Investigation

By going through the alphabet and identifying that, for a simpler version, all texts can be represented by grouped pieces of functions with restricted domains and ranges. E.g. the letter A can be regarded as a concave absolute value function with a steep gradient and grouped with a straight horizontal line somewhere in between the two halves of the graph.

Moreover, having to graph functions in a certain interval was something new and that I had to spend time researching.

## Preparation

For a quick visual start, I drew a quick sketch of the final graph on a grid paper:

During the action, however, due to the limitations of the calculator that only 20 functions can be entered and graphed at maximum, I had to change te design and end up with the following prototype and required equations:

/>

## Action

Inputting the functions into the calculator one by one; half way through the initial version:

/>

Upon reaching the limit of the graphing function, I implemented my new design and finally ended up with:

# Reflections...

## Beforehand

Producing the required functions one by one will require a lot of work but I personally think it is an excellent opportunity for me to learn how to take full advantages of the graphical calculators.

## During the Action

Calculating each piece of graph requires a lot of precise working out, which involves identifying the type of functions required for each piece and substituting correct values into the equations to determine the functions individually.

It was challenging and took a lot of time, although the process wasn't as dull as I anticipated.

In the middle, I realized that the calculator only allows up to 20 functions, and so I compromised and altered my design.

Most importantly, I learned to react to unexpected limitations which require certain changes, allowing myself to be more flexible at work and in my studies in future.

## Afterward

It was a long pocess having to design and redesign, implement and modify the graphs and functions. But it was worth the time as learning how to graph functions with restricted domains was also a target of mine.
