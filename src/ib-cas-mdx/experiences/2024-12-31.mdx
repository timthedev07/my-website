# Reflection

## 21/02/2024

Through a few days of warm-up sessions, I now feel immediately more physically and mentally joyous. This provided me with the opportunity to ponder upon the importance of physical exercise not only to myself, but also to a wide range of office workers and students in a global context. The increasing amount of stress unknowingly deprived us of exposure to indispensable body movement, and as a result, an increasing portion of the population within this group is suffering from health issues due to long working hours. This reinforces my determination to continue the experience and acquire more inspirational thoughts in the process.

Rope skipping, despite its negligible requirements for equipment and location, still may produce a certain level of disturbance in the neighborhood. Hence, out of ethical concerns, I chose to carry out the activity on the rooftop, at a time slot where no one else was there and so I could minimize the noise damage dealt to my neighbors.
