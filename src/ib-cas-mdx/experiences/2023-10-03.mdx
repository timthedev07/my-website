1. Identify your own strengths and develop areas for personal growth.
2. Demonstrate that challenges have been undertaken, developing new skills in the process.
3. Show commitment to and perseverance in CAS experiences.

# Reflections

Mathematics has always been a massive passion of mine. Since mid-year 10, I started to invest more time and effort into the subject, but mostly extracurricular and beyond-syllabus content, such as competition-styled questions. For the past two years, I have been the top scorer of the contest in my year group, and last year, with a decent score just above the grade boundary for the Maclaurin Olympiad, I participated in the next round and had the honor to gain competition experiences. Mathematical ability doesn't come from natural talent, at least not all. While I am certainly not one of the quickest to get things, working hard consistently does have an outstanding effect. Through the 2-year period of dedication to mathematics and curiosity for the subject, I am now able to progress at a decent pace and utilize my skills and knowledge to benefit myself and others.

The third year of UKMT is subtly different... In year 10, a month of intense hard work got me no more than 85/125. However, being determined and staying curious allows me to continuously explore the subject and extend my capabilities, to an extent where now, without much stressful preparation before the contest, I am able to handle the questions with relative ease compared to 1/2 years ago.
