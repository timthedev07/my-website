# Reflection

We initiated multiple two-on-two basketball games between the four of us. Due to the limited number of members on each of the teams, my active involvement in rebounding and in-paint defensive skills was crucial.

I had the opportunity to enhance my "box out" skills, which address the crucial capability of maintaining a position in which opponents are blocked from access to the rebound. It was totally new and challenging, as I had to consistently jump in the right direction and to the maximum possible height while facing the disruption and pressure created by opponents fighting for the rebound.

Overall, through more than 10 small-scale but intensive games that demanded massive flexibility in my role on the floor, I was challenged to discover and experiment with new skills, mainly rebounding and defense inside the paint. I am now more aware of my gap to fill in future games and more prepared to take on and learn about new and challenging roles on the court.
