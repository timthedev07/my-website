# Reflections

Today, I had the chance to play basketball with a few adults whom I had not played with before. Consequently, I was faced with the challenge of constantly adapting to the habits and styles of my new teammates. This provided me with the opportunity to take on new roles within the team. Previously, my role was mainly that of a shooter who moved actively around the three-point line. However, today our main strategy was to score within the paint or nearby. As a result, my role became to pass the ball to the right person and keep running until finding a wide-open spot for midrange shooting within the three-point line to ensure higher accuracy.

Overall, taking a break from my studies and participating in physically demanding sports activities was undoubtedly a necessity to maintain my health under the pressure of my studies, and I look forward to future sessions.
