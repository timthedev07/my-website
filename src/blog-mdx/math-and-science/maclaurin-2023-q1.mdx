# Problem Statement

A plank of wood has one end, A, against a vertical wall. Its other end, B, is on horizontal ground. When end A slips down 8cm, end B moves 4cm further away from the wall. When end A slips down a further 9cm, end B moves a further 3cm away from the wall. Find the length of the plank.

# My Solution

Based on the given information, we can construct a diagram similar to the one below (NOT drawn to scale):

where:

- $AA' = 8$
- $A'A'' = 9$
- $BB' = 4$
- $B'B'' = 3$

Let

- $AT = x$
- $BT = y$
- $t = AB = A'B' = A''B''$

Triangles $ABT$, $A'B'T$, and $A''B''T$ all have the same hypotenuse since the length
of the wood plank remains unchanged as it slips.

Thus a system of equations can be formed:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \begin{cases}
    (x + 17)^2 + y^2 = t^2 \\
    (x + 9)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = t^2 \\
    x^2 + (y + 7)^2 = t^2 \\
  \end{cases}\,
\end{aligned}
$$

Combining the first equation with the second:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(x + 17)^2 + y^2 &= (x + 9)^2 + (y + 4)^2 \\
x^2 + 34x + 289 + y^2 &= x^2 + 18x + 81 + y^2 + 8y + 16 \\
16x + 192 &= 8y \\
2x + 24 &= y\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Combining the third equation with the second:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 + (y + 7)^2 &= (x + 9)^2 + (y + 4)^2 \\
x^2 + y^2 + 14y + 49 &= x^2 + 18x + 81 + y^2 + 8y + 16 \\
6y = 18x + 48 \\
y = 3x + 8
\end{aligned}
$$

This obtains a new system of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \begin{cases}
    y = 3x + 8 \\
    y = 2x + 24
  \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

This gives $x = 16$ and $y = 56$. This pair of values can be substituted into any of the three original equations to find $t$ and they will give the same value. However, I personally find the second one giving nicer numbers:

$$
\begin{aligned}
t^2 &= (x + 9)^2 + (y + 4)^2 \\
&= 25^2 + 60^2 = 625 + 3600 = 4225 \\
t &= \sqrt{4225} = 65
\end{aligned}
$$
