# Quick Access

# Problem Statement

ABCD is a square and X is a point on the side DA such that the semicircle with diameter CX touches the side AB. Find the ratio AX:XD.

# My Solution

A diagram like the following can be drawn:

Let

- $r = XO = OC$ be the radius of the semicircle
- the length of the square be $2$

Now, if we were to construct the line $OQ$ perpendicular to $DC$ through $O$ and $PO$ perpendicular to $AD$:

We obtain two **congruent** triangles, namely $\Delta XOP$ and $\Delta OCQ$, since
they have equal angles and a hypotenuse of the same length (the radius).

Hence, $PO = DQ = QC$. So $Q$ is the midpoint of $DC$.

As the side length of the square is $2$, $DQ = QC = 1$.

By Pythagoras' theorem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
OQ = \sqrt{r^2 - 1^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

As $TQ$ is equal to the side length of the square: $TO + OQ = 2$, hence:

$$
\begin{aligned}
r + \sqrt{r^2 - 1} &= 2 \\
\sqrt{r^2 - 1} &= 2 - r \\
r^2 - 1 &= 4 - 4r + r^2 \\
4r &= 5 \\
r &= \frac{5}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the length of the diameter $XC = 2r = \frac{5}{2}$.

By Pythagoras' theorem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
XD &= \sqrt{XC^2 - DC^2} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{25}{4} - \frac{16}{4}} = \frac{3}{2} \\ \\
\therefore AX &= 2 - XD = \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The final answer is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
AX:XD = 1 : 3
\end{aligned}
$$
