# Introduction

This is the third part of first series â€” Derivatives, focused on the concept of the rate of change of a function.

Note: the content introduced in this series is mostly based on the IGCSE Further Math textbook.

# Rate of Change

Now, in calculus, the concept of rate of change is also important. It's simply a rate of how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable changes.

There are two types of rates of change we will look at here:

- Instantaneous rate of change
- Average rate of change

For example, for a linear function, the rate of change is **constant**, because there is a linear (straight line) correlation between the variables. And the rate also happens to be the derivative of the function, i.e. the gradient/slope of the line, as discussed above.

In contrast, a quadratic function, for example, would have a **variable rate of change** over an interval or a point. As you saw earlier, the derivative would produce an expression whose value actually depends on x; in other words, the derivative's value at different x coordinates may vary, unlike a linear function's derivative, which is a single constant that represents the gradient.

## Average Rate of Change

The average rate of change over an interval $[a, b]$ is the gradient of the secant line that passes through the curve at $x_1 = a$ and $x_2 = b$.

To calculate this, find the coordinates of the two points of intersection and calculate the gradient:

$$
\begin{align*}
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\end{align*}
$$

And to form an equation for the secant line:

$$
\begin{align*}
y = m(x - x_1) + y_1
\end{align*}
$$

### Its Correlation with Derivatives

Suppose there exists a tangent to the blue curve, whose corresponding function is $f(x)$, at point $P(x_0, f(x_0))$:

Start by picking another point on the curve, whose $x$-coordinate is displaced by $h$ units away from $x_0$ and $y$-coordinate is hence $f(x_0 + h)$

By dragging the new point closer and closer towards point $P$, $h$ gets smaller and smaller, and the gradient of the secant line approaches the tangent line:

At some point, when the second point reaches point $P$, the gradient of the two lines would be equal.

Given that the gradient of a straight line can be calculated by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
\end{aligned}
$$

we can define the tangent line's gradient using limits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Example

Let $f\left(x\right)\ =\ \frac{1}{20}x^{3}$, find the average rate of change over the interval $[1, 4]$, and hence the equation of the secant line.

$$
\begin{align*}
x_1 &= 1 \\
y_1 &= f(1) = 0.05 \\ \\

x_2 &= 4 \\
y_2 &= f(4) = 3.2 \\ \\

m &= \frac{3.15}{3} = 1.05 \\ \\

y &= 1.05(x - 1) + 0.05 = 1.05x - 1
\end{align*}
$$

Thus the average rate of change required is $1.05$ and the equation of the secant line drawn is $y = 1.05x - 1$.

## Instantaneous Rate Of Change

The instantaneous rate of change is the value of the derivative at a specific point on the curve of the function, i.e. the gradient of the tangent line at a point.

To calculate its value for a curve $f(x)$, is simply $f'(x)$, where $x$ is the x-coordinate of a point on the curve.

Take this as an example:

> The curve C is given by the equation $f(x) = 2x^2+4x-3$, find the instantaneous rate of change at the point (7, 123).

$$
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 4x + 4 \\
f'(7) = 32
\end{align*}
$$

In this case, $32$ represents the gradient of the line that's tangent to the curve at $(7, 123)$.
