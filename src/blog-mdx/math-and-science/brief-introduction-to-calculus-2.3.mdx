# Introduction

This series would primarily focus on the three fundamental areas of calculus - _derivatives_, _limits_, and _integration_, looking briefly at some of the different concepts to get started with calculus.; thus no prior knowledge of calculus is needed.

**This is the third chapter of the second part of the series, and it is about finding the area bounded by multiple curves or lines.**

**Further content on this topic will be published in separate articles for performance reasons.**

So now, let's sit back, relax, and have some fun!

## Area Between a Curve and Another Line/Curve

The formula for calculating the area between a curve and a line(or another curve), in the x interval $[a, b]$ is as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{a}^{b} y_1 - y_2\, dx
\end{align*}
$$

Where $y_1$ is the function of the curve/line above $y_2$.

Consider the following region:

In this case, $y_1$ is the function of the curve and $y_2$ is the function of the straight line, since in the required region, the curve is above the line.
