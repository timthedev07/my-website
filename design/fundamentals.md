## Color & Contrast

### An example of a poorly designed component color-wise

### Why Bad?

- Input placeholder doesn't have enough to contrast to be seen.
- Top and bottom part don't have enough contrast.

### Improvements

Now the bottom part contrasts with the top part.

Now the text in the upper part stands out a bit better
