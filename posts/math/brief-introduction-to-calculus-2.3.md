# Introduction

This series would primarily focus on the three fundamental areas of calculus - _derivatives_, _limits_, and _integration_, looking briefly at some of the different concepts to get started with calculus.; thus no prior knowledge of calculus is needed.

**This is the third chapter of the second part of the series, and it is about finding the area bounded by multiple curves or lines.**

**Further content on this topic will be published in separate articles for performance reasons.**

So now, let's sit back, relax, and have some fun!
