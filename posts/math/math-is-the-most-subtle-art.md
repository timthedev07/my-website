# Why I Love Math

If you think Math is nothing more than massive formulae, complex expressions, and incomprehensible algebra, then you're wrong, fundamentally wrong! When you dive into the ocean of Math, the most simplistic and aesthetic form of art, you would realize the gate to the new world that is opened up to you.

### Why Do Some People Find Math Hard and "Obsolete"

From my observation of the students around me, spending the entire day on a "dull" math problem is something that is considered only psychopaths do. Maybe they haven't yet experienced the exhilaration of victory that floods your entire body when you finally come to a solution to a fascinating puzzle; maybe they haven't realized how much they would have gained intellectually in the process of searching for a solution, and maybe they haven't seen the real-world benefits of using logic and problem-solving skills to resolve day-to-day issues encountered in life.

But math is far beyond what could be seen from the surface.

### Applications In Life

When you pull the formulae, equations, and graphs out of sheets of paper and bring them into real life, their significance in human civilization would shine under the sunlight like a sharp and imperishable sword cutting through the fog in our life.

Intrinsically math is the basic building block of all human activities; it's anywhere in our life and yet it is almost as if it lives in another dimension. Mathematics supports the fundamental understanding of our world, and it's anywhere from counting the number of apples on a shelf, to complex scientific computing dealing with a vast amount of data.

Its magic applies everywhere in our life, but realistically, here are some jobs where mathematics comes in very handy/is a necessity, just to name a few:

- Programmer
- Data Scientist
- Financial Analyst
- Economist
- Engineer

### Conclusion

Math is unquestionably my favorite art, it expresses its spirits in a way no other forms of art can, and the moment you blow off the dust on it and the treasure chest comes into sight is simply mindblowing; aside from the satisfaction, it gives me, the thought process and how I approach a problem is really the most fascinating part.
