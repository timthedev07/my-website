## Introduction

This blog would primarily focus on the three fundamental areas of calculus - _differentiation_, _limits_, and _integration_; thus no prior knowledge of calculus is needed.

Note: the content covered here would only require a solid understanding of basic algebra.

So now, let's sit back, relax, and have some fun!

## Functions

Functions are the way we define the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable. Like in computer science, a function has an input(mathematically called a variable) and an output(the value of a function).

For example, a quadratic equation in the form of $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ could be written as $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ where $y = f(x)$.

In the example above, $ax^2 + bx + c$ would be the expression for the **value of the function** $f(x)$, i.e. the output, but it's also a representation of the relationship between $f(x)$, or $y$, and $x$; likewise $x$ would be the variable, i.e. the input.

Graphically, this is the equivalent of: for each x-coordinate, calculate its corresponding y-coordinate using $f(x)$; and the point $P(x, f(x))$ would hence be plotted, for example, on a cartesian graph.

## Differentiation

Differentiation in calculus refers to the process of finding the derivative of a function, which also represents the rate of change of a function.

The mathematical representation of the derivative of a function is $f'(x)$ where the number of apostrophes after $f$ indicates the nth derivative of function $f(x)$; meanwhile you can also say that the first derivative of $y$, **with respect to** $x$, is $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Furthermore, the $n$th derivative of y is written as $\Large\frac{d^{n - 1}y}{dx^{n - 1}}$

Not only can we calculate the derivative of a function, we can also calculate the derivative of a derivative. This might sound a bit confusing, but to put simply, say we have a function $f(x)$, its **first derivative** is $f'(x)$, and the derivative of the first derivative, i.e. the **second derivative** of $f(x)$, would be $f''(x)$, so on and so forth.

A function's derivative can be calculated by applying some rules _**to each term of the expression**_.

The following table contains the fundamental rules of differentiation to get you started with:
