# Character Analysis: Of Mice and Men - Curley

### Introduction

Throughout the entirety of the novel, Steinbeck uses Curley to explore the themes of violence, power, loneliness, and superficiality. Curley is the boss's son who was born more privileged and he is a symbolism of the people on the top of the social hierarchy.

### Theme: Violence + Authority

Steinbeck presents Curley as a hostile character because of his violence and also the superiority he senses towards others on the ranch due to the power he has as the boss's son as "He's alla time picking scraps with big guys". This demonstrates the representation of men in 1930s America which was linked to power, authority, physical strength, and aggressiveness, but more importantly, they were considered to have more power over women in the male-dominated society. However, Curley's use of violence to threaten others on the ranch is constantly contrasted with how Slim earns everyone's respect with his kindness and understanding, which indicates that violence should not be the way to gain power and approval. As a reader, we can learn that violence was common among men in 1930s America since most of the migrant farm workers weren't well educated and thus they lacked the ability to maintain a respectable social profile.

### Criticism of Capitalism - Themes: Authority + Capitalism

Furthermore, Steinbeck also portrays Curley as a superficial character. Curley was first introduced as the boss's son who wears "high-heeled boots and spurs to prove he was not a laboring man", this reveals that he is trying to distinguish himself from the farmworkers with artificial representations of wealth and power because he lacks actual estimable achievements. Steinbeck criticizes the shallow society in 1930s America where authority was measured with materialistic possessions such as high-heeled boots and money. Due to the Great Depression, one of the worst economic catastrophes in the US history, many people continued to struggle in the lower class of the social hierarchy due to poverty and/or discrimination, and even some of the middle class people were forced to go down for a living, and thus this gives Curley a special sense of pride as he is still in the middle class and as a result, he puts his identity over others' and thinks he has the right to be mean and aggressive to others. From a reader's perspective, Steinbeck gave us an insight to the vanity of people in society at that time, and it is in fact, telling us that this is the incorrect way of trying to increase one's social status.

### Poor Interpersonal Relationships - Themes: Loneliness

Despite his violence and superficiality, he is also lonely. He doesn't have a valuable relationship with any of the farmworkers nor his wife, and this is because he's very aggressive and always willing to engage in fights with people, meanwhile, this is also because in 1930s America, the migrant farmworkers had to travel around a lot from ranch to ranch to work, so there weren't any opportunities for Curley to develop long-term relationships with them. Moreover, he has a brittle relationship with his wife, and this is shown by the lack of trust and respect between them, given that Curley treats her wife like possession and limits her freedom by "locking her up" in their room, and this is, again reinforced when her wife was "suddenly apprehensive" when she learned that Curley's looking for her because she was afraid that he might do something unacceptable to her if he finds out that she left the area she's supposed to be in. But ultimately the reason why Curley married his wife is only because of her physical appearance, this denotes that Curley is trying to exhibit his capability marriage-wise by marrying someone pretty, and this reflects that in 1930s America, women's beauty were the only value seen in them and this expresses how shallow society was in 1930s America.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, not only did Steinbeck use the character of Curley to illustrate the superficiality in capitalist society, Curley was also a perfect caricature of the ideologies of violence, power, and loneliness in 1930s America.
