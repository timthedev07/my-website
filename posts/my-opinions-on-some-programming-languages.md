# My Opinions on Some Programming Languages

There's tons of programming languages out there for different purposes, I used to search what are the best languages to learn everyday when I first started out. Ones like Rust, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Golang, and Java appear the most. But then after trying some of the languages out I realized they are just not my type, or in other words, they are not suitable for my purposes. On the other hand, I quite liked some other ones and I decided to just stick to them. In this blog, I'm going to be walking through some of my experiences learning and using different languages.

For example, I took a web development course(which brought me into the software industry first, so thank you) in Python with Django. To be honest, I think python is a nice language for beginners like I was, because you don't need to worry about memory management, types(mostly), pointers, and other things since Python does that for you underneath the hood. At first I was pretty happy having this "freedom", but then after the codebase scales, it's just a nightmare to refactor and clean up the code.

I tried JavaScript with React afterward and completed a few simple projects, and I decided to really dive into React or frontend web development in general, because I liked it a lot. JavaScript was actually OK for me at that time, it's robust and applicable almost everywhere.

Somewhere halfway down, I was introduced to the language 'Typescript - JavaScript that Scale', which is currently my favorite language, so, I decided to give Typescript React a shot.

Initially I struggled a lot with stuff like generics, weird looking type annotations, intersection and union types, and I found the static typing part very constraining because I don't have that "freedom" I used to have with Python and JavaScript.

As I got better at it and used to it, it's becoming harder for me to go back to dynamic typing languages to build something serious and complex.

In the same month, C++ came into my way and I was like, why not try it out. I learned some of the syntax and fundamental concepts and it was quite easy for me since I have some prior experience using C, then I stumbled upon algorithm styled questions. I first started doing some of the easy ones on LeetCode with cpp, and it was definitely a disaster, I couldn't even solve a easy problem like two sum, without exceeding time limit because I didn't even know data structures and algorithms. So, I went all the way back to learn some data structures like stack, queue, unordered_map and unordered_set with C++.

Not gonna lie, I actually thought of switching to Python or TypeScript because 40% of the time I was just dealing with address boundary errors and other low level mistakes. Then, things started to get better as I completed more questions and got more familiar with data structures and algorithms, and then I was dedicated to stick to C++ for this sort of programming, and partially because it is the choice of most many programmers.

Now, I'm doing algorithms styled questions on a daily basis on LeetCode and other websites, you can find the challenge [here](https://github.com/timthedev07/200algo-in-200days).
