# My Opinions on Some Programming Languages

There's tons of programming languages out there for different purposes, I used to search what are the best languages to learn everyday when I first started out. Ones like Rust, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Java appear the most. But then after trying some of the languages out I realized they are just not my type, or in other words, they are not suitable for my purposes.

For example, I took a web development course(which brought me into the software industry first, so thank you) in Python with Django. To be honest, I think python is a nice language for beginners, like I was, because you don't need to worry about memory management, types(mostly), pointers, and other things since Python does that for you underneath the hood. At first I was pretty happy having this "freedom", but then after the codebase scales, it's just a nightmare to refactor and clean up the code.

I tried JavaScript with React afterward and completed a few simple projects, and I decided to really dive into React because I liked it a lot. JavaScript was actually OK for me at that time, it's robust and applicable almost everywhere. Somewhere halfway down, I was introduced to the language 'Typescript - JavaScript that Scale', which is currently my favorite language.

Initially I struggled a lot with stuff like generics, weird looking type annotations and interfaces, and I found it quite static typing part constraining because I don't have that "freedom" I used to have with Python and JavaScript.
