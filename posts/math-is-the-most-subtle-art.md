# Why I Love Math

If you think Math is nothing more than massive formulae, complex expressions, and incomprehensible algebra, then you're wrong, fundamentally wrong! When you dive into the ocean of Math, the most simplistic and aesthetic form of art, you would realize the gate to the new world that is opened up to you.

## Why Do Some People Find Math Hard and "Obsolete"

From my observation of the students around me, spending the entire day on a "dull" math problem is something that is considered only psycho paths do. Maybe they haven't yet experienced the exhilaration of victory that floods your entire body when you finally come to a solution to a fascinating puzzle; maybe they haven't realized how much they would have gained intellectually in the process of searching for a solution; and maybe they haven't seen the real-world benefits of using logic and problem solving skills to resolve day-to-day issues encountered in life.

But math is far beyond what could be seen from the surface.

## Applications In Life

When you pull the formulae, equations, and graphs out of sheets of paper and bring them into real life, its significance in the human civilization would shine under the sunlight like a sharp and imperishable sword cutting through the fog in our life.
