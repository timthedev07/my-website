## Problem Statement

NOTE: This is adapted from [problem 15 of project euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15)

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
